* Keplers 3 Laws of Planetary Motion (NSSI vid)
**** all planets orbit in an ellipse, to make one you need 2 foci (pl. for focus) 
**** when 2 foci on top of eachother you have a perfect circle
**** 2nd law is all orbrits sweep out equal areas at equal time
**** mechanical energy is potential + kinectic 
**** periapsis close to body being orbited 
**** 3rd law, semi-major axis proportional to the planets period
**** Newton proved this later? Kepler was early early 1600s
* Gravity (NSSI vid)
*** gravity is a field force not contact force... 
*** satellites are falling in space, not flying!
*** 8 km/s is the minimum speed
*** zero gravity is a misnomer
* Electromagnetic Spectrum basics (NSSI vid)
**** it is light, and describes the total light/energy/radiation
**** light is made of electric fields and magnetic fields
**** distance of wavelength and the rate these waves pass are called frequency
**** smaller wavelength means larger frequency
**** they are inversely proportional! 
**** differences between frequency makes up the spectrum...
**** radio waves have the largest waves (shortest frequency up to 300MHz)
**** visible light is the part of the spectrum our eyes are most sensitive to
**** wouldn't it be cool to have a super hero power with eyes covering more spectrum?
**** gamma waves are 10 picometers or the size of atoms, and include hotest parts of universe (suns)
**** gamme waves used to detect other elements on distant planets
**** 3 ways materials interact with waves: obsorb, reflect, or pass through
**** this is the way mass interacts with energy
**** some areas of the spectrum obsorb (or partially) the wave
**** others pass through, he calls this the transmission window
**** all objects above 0 degree kelvin emits energy
**** when em radiation strikes an obj energy is either transmitted (goes through)
**** bounces off, or addes energy to the obj (obsorb)

* Space mission operations
*** pnt is positioning, navigation and timing
*** a pnt system includes everyone who uses this data like google maps, banking, etc
*** the user segment is the reason we do the mission 
*** ground segment sends commands to the bus portion of the sat
*** conops is a verbal or visual description of a system
*** for example space segment and ground segment
*** is it safe to say, our launch vehicle provider is ULA? 
*** c3 tracking telemetry & commanding
***  tracking knowing where it is and where its going
*** ground survelliance network essential in tracking
*** tearr data - azimuth, epoch time, elevation, range, range rate (has fast range is changing)
*** determing dopler shift?
*** telemetry is nothing more but satellite bus and payload data
*** for ex. voltage, temp, mission data
*** tearr data comes from the TLE data set
*** nodes are ground stations, sats, and control centers (buildings)
*** cross link used if the sat needed is not in view
* What is ESXi? 20min 
**** there is a free version with a relaxed license!
**** look into raid, how would I set this up?
**** vCenter is a vm itself, to manage vms
**** thus it's a "type 2" while esxi is type 1
**** 2 mgmt interfaces: flash and html5 based console
**** virtual machine cloning, vMotion, HA, Fault Tolerance, etc 
**** power cli? this and the other advanced features makes vCenter very fancy!
**** sorry ESXi you are the Emmanual Sanders to Michael Thomas 
* Scott Manley Orbits Explained
*** Israel is a unique case, they launch towards the West, out towards the Mediterranean
*** polar orbits all the sat to see ALL of the earth, Sun Sync orbit is 98 deg
*** this is slightly retrograde
***  
* Socratica has space videos! 
**** foci, further apart = skinnier 
**** measuring this "skinniness" is measuring eccentricity 
**** Neutron star = 
**** stars spend their life fusing atoms together, it's this that causes the starts to shine
**** fusion has stopped for white drarfs but they still shine b/c of the heat
**** Schwarchild radius = danger zone of a black hole
**** neutrons are neutral particles 
**** James Chadwick
**** electron capture = when electrons and protons collide they create neutrinos (which fly off) and neutrons
**** gravity squeezes electrons and neutrons together this is causing neutrinos
**** Inbetween white dwarfs and black holes are neutron stars
**** you can find neutrons in most atoms
