* Essential COM by Don Box (free on google books)
** What's the 1st chapters title? *LOL
*** COM as a better cpp
** What was the first c++ dev product from Bell Laboratories? 
*** CFRONT
** What is UDTs and what are they good for?
*** user defined types, could be reused outside original context
** What is the coupling effect?
*** where the application is "coupled" closely to the class library.
*** fragile code base over time
*** reduses "modularity" of a class library & difficult to adapt to changes
** Why is the cpp object model not great for building resusable components?
*** because of 'runtime obstacles' like compilation and linkage
* Why aren't libraries enough? *Binary Components :)  
** How long, or what is, the algorithmic complexity of a string search?
*** O(1)
** What did user expect to add to get a working application?
*** the sources FILES (include a make file?) to recompile locally...
** What would need to be bundled as part of the overall application?
*** the executable code of the library
* Dynamic Linking
** What happens when a programmer uses __declspec(d11export) ?
*** the linker connects the executable to the DLL to load the needed code
*** 'stubs' are created in the exe to inform the loader
*** methods are added to the export list of the DLL
*** runtime resolution of each method
*** linker produces an import library that exposes symbols of the needed method
*** what does it mean to resolve symbols to locations in memory?
** How large are DLL files? Examples plz, most common is great.
*** ?
** Who creates DLL files? COM files?
*** 
* Encapsulation ez good
** Where is the length calculation stored?
*** in the constructor, to allocate the buffer
** Describe a source code control system?
*** ...
** Does cpp support encapsulation?
*** syntactic encap yes, using private and protected keywords
** What is binary encapsulation? Does modern cpp now support it?
*** ?
** What is rude?
*** writing a pointer to a string at a location belonging to someone else
** What's the problem with DLLs?
*** versioning can lead to problems(exceptions), and ultimately to OS bulk 
* Interface vs Implementation
