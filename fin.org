Mostly notes from youtube videos on finance/federal reserve
* Bernanke lecture @ GW on youtube pt 1
**** says a "tool" for central banks to use is monetary policy, incorrect word, it's a toolbox!
**** I do agree though, the second one on his list is a tool: lender of last resort
**** the third tool is 'financial regulation' but this is not unique to central banks, many govt agencies also regulate
**** concept of a central bank goes back to Sweden 1668, England in 1694 and France (1800) wow late Fr?
* Causes of Inflation by Marginal Revolution Univ
**** m = money supply, v = velocity of money, y = real gdp , p= price
**** velocity of $ is # of times a dollar changes hands in a year
**** Inflation can be seen using the Consumer Price Index (avg cost of goods/services)
* 2017 Fink Con Neel Kashkari
**** NK started as an Aerospace eng @ TRW
**** interesting, there are "black out" dates when fed employees can't talk monetary policy
**** NK thinks banks need more capital as a buffer so failure doesn't happen again
**** "they move as a pack"
