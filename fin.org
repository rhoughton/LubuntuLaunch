* Bernanke lecture @ GW on youtube
** says a "tool" for central banks to use is monetary policy, incorrect word, it's a toolbox!
** I do agree though, the second one on his list is a tool: lender of last resort
** the third tool is 'financial regulation' but this is not unique to central banks, many govt agencies also regulate
** concept of a central bank goes back to Sweden 1668, England in 1694 and France (1800) wow late Fr?
