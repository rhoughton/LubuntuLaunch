* Keplers 3 Laws of Planetary Motion (NSSI vid)
** all planets orbit in an ellipse, to make one you need 2 foci (pl. for focus) 
** when 2 foci on top of eachother you have a perfect circle
** 2nd law is all orbrits sweep out equal areas at equal time
** mechanical energy is potential + kinectic 
** periapsis close to body being orbited 
** 3rd law, semi-major axis proportional to the planets period
** Newton proved this later? Kepler was early early 1600s
* Gravity (NSSI vid)
** gravity is a field force not contact force... 
** satellites are falling in space, not flying!
** 8 km/s is the minimum speed
** zero gravity is a misnomer
* Electromagnetic Spectrum basics (NSSI vid)
** it is light, and describes the total light/energy/radiation
** light is made of electric fields and magnetic fields
** distance of wavelength and the rate these waves pass are called frequency
** smaller wavelength means larger frequency
** they are inversely proportional! 
** differences between frequency makes up the spectrum...
** radio waves have the largest waves (shortest frequency up to 300MHz)
** visible light is the part of the spectrum our eyes are most sensitive to
** wouldn't it be cool to have a super hero power with eyes covering more spectrum?
** gamma waves are 10 picometers or the size of atoms, and include hotest parts of universe (suns)
** gamme waves used to detect other elements on distant planets
** 3 ways materials interact with waves: obsorb, reflect, or pass through
** this is the way mass interacts with energy
** some areas of the spectrum obsorb (or partially) the wave
** others pass through, he calls this the transmission window
** all objects above 0 degree kelvin emits energy
** when em radiation strikes an obj energy is either transmitted (goes through)
** bounces off, or addes energy to the obj (obsorb)

* Space mission operations
** pnt is positioning, navigation and timing
** a pnt system includes everyone who uses this data like google maps, banking, etc
** the user segment is the reason we do the mission 
** ground segment sends commands to the bus portion of the sat
** conops is a verbal or visual description of a system
** for example space segment and ground segment
** is it safe to say, our launch vehicle provider is ULA? 
** c3 tracking telemetry & commanding
**  tracking knowing where it is and where its going
** ground survelliance network essential in tracking
** tearr data - azimuth, epoch time, elevation, range, range rate (has fast range is changing)
** determing dopler shift?
** telemetry is nothing more but satellite bus and payload data
** for ex. voltage, temp, mission data
** tearr data comes from the TLE data set
** nodes are ground stations, sats, and control centers (buildings)
** cross link used if the sat needed is not in view
